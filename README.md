| WN10-AC-000010 | This PowerShell script ensures that the account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system. The higher this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system. The number of bad logon attempts must be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user logon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Powershell | [View Script](https://github.com/cherinejoseph/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations/blob/main/STIG-ID-WN10-AC-000010-Remediation.ps1)                                                                                                    |
| WN10-AC-000035 | This PowerShell script ensures that Information systems not protected with strong password schemes (including passwords of minimum length) provide the opportunity for anyone to crack the password, thus gaining access to the system and compromising the device, information, or the local network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Powershell | [View Script](https://github.com/cherinejoseph/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations/blob/main/STIG-ID-WN10-AC-000035-Remediation.ps1)                                                                                                    |
| WN10-CC-000195 | This PowerShell script ensures that enhanced anti-spoofing for facial recognition must be enabled on Windows 10. Enhanced anti-spoofing provides additional protections when using facial recognition with devices that support it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Powershell | [View Script](https://github.com/cherinejoseph/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations/blob/main/STIG-ID-WN10-CC-000195-Remediation.ps1)                                                                                                    |

| WN10-CC-000206 | This PowerShell script ensures that Windows Update must not obtain updates from other PCs on the internet. Windows 10 allows Windows Update to obtain updates from additional sources instead of Microsoft. In addition to Microsoft, updates can be obtained from and sent to PCs on the local network as well as on the internet. This is part of the Windows Update trusted process; however, to minimize outside exposure, obtaining updates from or sending to systems on the internet must be prevented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Powershell | [View Script](https://github.com/cherinejoseph/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations/blob/main/STIG-ID-WN10-CC-000206-Remediation.ps1)                                                                                                    |
| WN10-CC-000252 | This PowerShell script ensures that Windows 10 must be configured to disable Windows Game Recording and Broadcasting.

| WN10-CC-000260 | This PowerShell script ensures that Windows 10 must be configured to require a minimum pin length of six characters or greater. Windows allows the use of PINs as well as biometrics for authentication without sending a password to a network or website where it could be compromised. Longer minimum PIN lengths increase the available combinations an attacker would have to attempt. Shorter minimum length significantly reduces the strength.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Powershell | [View Script](https://github.com/cherinejoseph/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations/blob/main/STIG-ID-WN10-CC-000260-Remediation.ps1)                                                                                                    |
