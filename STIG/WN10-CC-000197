.SYNOPSIS
    This PowerShell script ensures that Microsoft consumer experiences provides suggestions and notifications to users, which may include the installation of Windows Store apps. Organizations may control the execution of applications through other means such as whitelisting. Turning off Microsoft consumer experiences will help prevent the unwanted installation of suggested applications.
